This app allows users to explore April 1 estimates from the Office of Financial Management (OFM) for jurisdictions within the Central Puget Sound Region in Washington State. 

Estimates are available between years 2000 to 2020 using a combination of intercensal and postcensal data for counties, cities, and towns within the region. Total Population estimates are available for the full 20 year period while other datasets such as Household and Group Quarters Population, Total Housing Units, and Households are currently only available for years 2000 to 2010.
